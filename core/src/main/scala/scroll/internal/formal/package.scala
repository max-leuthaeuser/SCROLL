package scroll.internal

/**
 * This package contains the Scala reference implementation of the role-based modeling language for Compartment Role Object Models (CROM)
 * and Compartment Role Object Instances (CROI), as well as Constraint Models. The implementation is kept simple, comprehensive, and more
 * importantly close to their formalization. This is an adaption of [[https://github.com/Eden-06/formalCROM]].
 *
 * The reference implementation contains the following classes:
 * $ - [[scroll.internal.formal.CROM]] representing a Compartment Role Object Model
 * $ - [[scroll.internal.formal.CROI]] a Compartment Role Object Instance
 * $ - [[scroll.internal.formal.FormalRoleGroup]] the notion of a Role Group
 * $ - [[scroll.internal.formal.FormalConstraintModel]] a Constraint Model
