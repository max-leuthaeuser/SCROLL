package scroll.internal

/** This package contains the Scala reference implementation of the role-based modeling language for
  * Compartment Role Object Models (CROM) and Compartment Role Object Instances (CROI), as well as
  * Constraint Models. The implementation is kept simple, comprehensive, and more importantly close
  * to their formalization. This is an adaption of [[https://github.com/Eden-06/formalCROM]].
  *
  * The reference implementation contains the following classes:
  *   - [[scroll.internal.formal.CROM]] representing a Compartment Role Object Model
  *   - [[scroll.internal.formal.CROI]] a Compartment Role Object Instance
  *   - [[scroll.internal.formal.FormalRoleGroup]] the notion of a Role Group
  *   - [[scroll.internal.formal.FormalConstraintModel]] a Constraint Model
